/**
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a 
palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s. 

 A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward. 

 
 Example 1: 
 Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
 Example 2: 
 Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
 
 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= s.length <= 16 
 s contains only lowercase English letters.
